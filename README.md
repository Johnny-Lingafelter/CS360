*Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirements of my Inventory App were to use a login screen allowing a user to login or create a new login, to allow a user to view, add, edit, and delete an item in the database, and to request the user's permission to use SMS functionality to allow the app to send them a text message when an item was out of stock. The goal of the app was to allow a user to track items relevant to them, and it addresses the user's need to organize items that they could not otherwise manually keep track of.

*What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

My app consists of three screens, two dialogs, and numerous toast messages. A login screen, an inventory screen (main screen), and an add item screen were necessary to support my user's needs. A dialog for creating a new user was used, and another for asking the user for permission to send SMS. Toast messages were used frequently throughout the app to provide the user with feedback and pertinent information. I tried to keep the user in mind by implementing a consistent theme throughout the screens of the app, and by writing the app to be intuitive and logical from the user's perspective. I feel my designs were successful because I kept the user in mind.

*How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached the coding of my app in pieces. First, I created the InventoryDatabase class and wrote the SQL to create the tables for the app. Then I worked on the login screen. Next, I got the Add Item activity functioning. And finally, I worked on the main screen of the app, the inventory screen. The strategy that worked best for me was to write very small chunks of code and continually test those pieces, slowly adding new functionality when I had accomplished something. Constant testing is a must for me, as if I get too deep into a project without testing, I usually find myself overwhelmed and up against a wall. Learning how to use the Logcat feature of Android Studio also helped immensely when finding the cause of crashes and errors.

*How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I tested my app in small pieces, building one after the other. When I had a finished a piece of functionality, I would immediately test it. I also relied heavily on using the debugger to see what data my app was processing at any given time. These processes are important because I feel that if I didn't know exactly what was going on within my app, I would not understand how to complete it properly.

*Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The most innovation definitely came in the final stages of development. I have never worked with app development before, so at first the challenge of coding the app was quite daunting. By searching online and finding examples of the code I needed to write, I was able to apply that to my project and overcome the hurdles I faced.

*In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I think the login screen was the most successful component of my app. I have worked with login logic before, and this came fairly easily to me. I felt that the code I used to write the login module was well organized and optimized.
